### Hi there, my name is Lewis ðŸ‘‹
I'm a hobbyist software developer from Melbourne, Australia. 

I am currently studying:
- Networking
- Cyber Security

I am interested in playing and modding video games in my spare time. 

I run [cyberbilby.com](https://cyberbilby.com) where I post articles, blogs and tutorials relating to what I am interested in.
